- add more hook entry points
- test real use cases
- make the default calls print out what git is running (and make it simple enough for normal users to understand)
- write a setup (or init) command to give you sane default settings
- support sending pull requests to github
- write tests for cleanup
- move reset_lower_envs out into a real command maybe?
